As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
â€˜Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
